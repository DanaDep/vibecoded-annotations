Simple annotations for marking unverified AI-generated code.

## What is VibeCoded?

**VibeCoded** is a lightweight annotation library that helps you track which parts of your codebase were generated by AI tools. 

## Installation

### Maven

Add this dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.danadep</groupId>
    <artifactId>vibecoded-annotations</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
```

### Gradle

Add this to your `build.gradle`:

```gradle
dependencies {
    compileOnly 'io.github.danadep:vibecoded-annotations:1.0.0'
}
```

Or for Gradle Kotlin DSL (`build.gradle.kts`):

```kotlin
dependencies {
    compileOnly("io.github.danadep:vibecoded-annotations:1.0.0")
}
```

> **Note:** Use `compileOnly` (or `provided` scope) since these are source-level annotations that don't need to be in your runtime classpath.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```java
import io.github.danadep.vibecoded.VibeCoded;

@VibeCoded(tool = "Claude")
public class UserController {
	// This code needs human review
}
```

### Human-Verified Code

```java
@VibeCoded(tool = "ChatGPT", humanVerified = true)
public class PaymentService {
    // This code has been reviewed and is good to go
}
```

## Why Use VibeCoded?
Signal to other developers that code may require closer review or may follow different patterns than hand-written code.

## Annotation Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `tool` | String | No       | - | Name of the AI tool used (e.g., "Claude", "ChatGPT") |
| `humanVerified` | boolean | No       | `false` | Whether code has been reviewed by a human |
